# Fantasy Football Drafting with Reinforcement Learning

Success in fantasy football heavily relies on the strategic drafting of a fantasy team. This study
proposes a custom OpenAI Gym environment, enabling reinforcement learning agents to draft a
fantasy football team by using historical NFL data. With the custom environment, reinforcement
learning agents are developed, revealing the success of a Proximal Policy Optimization agent
compared to other reinforcement learning algorithms, along with besting the most popular
computer strategy used in the domain. An analysis of the agentâ€™s decision-making process is
offered to better understand effective drafting strategy, unveiling its prioritization in the
selection of running backs and tight ends during the initial stages of the draft, followed by wide
receivers and quarterbacks.
